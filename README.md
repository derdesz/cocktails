You can find the backend repository here: https://github.com/derdesz/cocktails-spring.git

Our cocktail site is an application for searching and filtering cocktail recipes, adding new ones and saving your favorites into the database. 
Search by name or ingredient; filter by alcoholic/non-alcoholic property or spirits and view ingredients and instructions of the cocktails.

The front end was created with the React library, Bootstrap and Material UI was used for designing elements. 

It is possible to register and login, in order to be able to upload new recipes and collect favorite cocktail recipes. The login information and favorite cocktails are then stored in Hibernate in the backend. 

### Future plans:
- corrections in security (backend)
- image upload (frontend & backend)
- bug fix: collecting favorite cocktails

### Installations:
- npm install
- npm install axios
- npm install js-cookie --save
- npm install --save react-router-dom

### Running the app:
- run 'npm start' from the terminal
